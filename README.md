# how-bout-those-dreams
A little idea I had a few days ago, thought it'd be cool to make something out of it.
I'm trying to make a rpg where your character is given an item that sends them to another world in there dreams. The world is more hostile and the character is made to go on adventure to protect from some big baddie.
I thought it'd be a pretty cool idea


Features I would like to include:
- Working text based map
- Storyline
- Possible Magic
- Fighting
- Random battles in the dreamworld
- Several quests
- Many places to travel in the world
- NPCs
- Allies from the real world who somehow connect to the dream world
