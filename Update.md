So, Small development on the project, Disregard most of what is on the README.md file. I realise now what I need to accomplish
first is making a system I can implement the game into. So what I mean is having a map system where things can be moved on and
interacted with like most systems. Along with that a random encounter system that can turn on and off depending on the map. 
basically the whole game with no flavor text. So I guess that means to start from the beginning. I'm updating the Map Code 
right now which I'll pull into a new file for the whole game.
