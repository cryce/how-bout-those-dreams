# how-bout-those-dreams
A little idea I had a few days ago, thought it'd be cool to make something out of it.
I'm trying to make a rpg where your character is given an item that sends them to another world in there dreams. The world is more hostile and all injuries translate over to his/her own.
I thought it'd be a pretty cool idea
